# Pixie for Discord

Pixie is a divination Discord bot (for fun, not actual fortune telling). You send it the command '+pixie' and it returns a card. The cards are from the Waite-Smith deck, also known as the Rider-Waite deck.

## Setup

If you want to invite Pixie to your existing server, just point your browser at https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=812842157416775681&scope=bot .

## Usage

In the Discord server running Pixie, type:

```
+pixie
```

A random card's image and meaning will be returned to the channel.

You can also send a DM to Pixie, just like you would DM any other Discord user, and she will return your card privately.

## Notes

Pixie was the nickname of Pamela Coleman Smith, the artist of the Waite-Smith deck.
